#### - Kart is...

my personal kind-of project where I'm trying to create relatively simple and small programming that will be capable of doing real-world stuff such as: _basisc arithmetics operations_, _context switching_, _pointers logic (without actual pointers like in C)_, _structural data representation_, _access to exported symbols_. And that's it for now. There's already a lot of work down here for a single person. The list of _features_ will grow eventually, when I'll cover all these topics.

#### - At the end of the day...

I want to make a series of programs on it to prove it's capabilities, and eventually use it to make itself. When this will happen, I'd say _"hell yeah! I made a language! A programming one!"_

But this day will come not so soon...

### Degree of _"readiness"_... 

|status|feature|description|
|-|-|-|
|🛠|scanner|scans the source code and turns it into tokens, which are then processed
|🛠|parser|performs a complete analysis of the token list and produces a complete syntax tree
|🛠|semantic analyzer|analyzes the resulting syntax tree for semantic errors and inaccuracies, producing a list of diagnostic messages.
|🛠|llvm backend|one of the options for implementing the backend. Performs many optimizations internally over LLVM IR (intermediate representation) and then generates execute code to the target platform.
|🛠|custom backend| TBD
|🛠|emmiter| TBD
